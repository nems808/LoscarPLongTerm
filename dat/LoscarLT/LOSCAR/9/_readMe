- Running from Present to Past
-Temperature of ocean boxes is now calculated based on Berner using pco2 and
    the linearly changing solar constant.
- Mg linearly interpolated between 30 and 53 mmol between 58Ma and 0
- Ca interpol between 20 and 10.3 between 58 Ma and 0
- Thus Ca not predicted anymore, but the tracers is still there, however 
deriv set to be unchanging.
- INTEPOLATING rrain constant at modern (6.1)
- INTEPOLATING fsh constant at 1
- nshT NOT interpolated because shelf rain becomes too large
- INTEPOLATING Thermohaline (TH0) constant at 25
- INTEPOLATING constant Mixing (mv0 and mhd0)
- INTEPOLATING Tethys Thermohaline constant at 2 Sv
- INTEPOLATING NADW to SO circulation from 10 to 30 Ma
- Fin contrib to P weather 0.0, FSi 1.0
- Q10 = 4, no temperature dependency
- Bathymetry interpolated based on Malte
