- test Run
- The same as 12 except using the actual Mg and Ca data
-Temperature of ocean boxes is now calculated based on Berner using pco2 and
    the linearly changing solar constant.
- Mg and Ca using the ACTUAL DATA NOW
- Thus Ca not predicted anymore, but the tracers is still there, however 
deriv set to be unchanging.
- INTEPOLATING rrain constant at modern (6.1)
- INTEPOLATING fsh. Pacific paleo fsh higher 4.5->6
- nshT NOT interpolated because shelf rain becomes too large
- INTEPOLATING Thermohaline (TH0) constant at 25
- INTEPOLATING constant Mixing (mv0 and mhd0)
- INTEPOLATING Tethys Thermohaline constant at 2 Sv
- Smooth NADW to SO circulation switch from 0 to 10 Ma
- Fin contrib to P weather 0.2, FSi 0.8
- Q10 = 8, no temperature dependency
- Bathymetry interpolated based on Malte
