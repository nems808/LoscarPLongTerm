Introduction:

These supplementary data are a new 20 Ma composite record of d18O and d13C. Over 14,000 measurements of planktic and benthic foraminifera from the Pacific Ocean were compiled from published records. The data set includes several records from the previously published benthic isotope stack of Zachos et al. [2001]. Age models were updated to the geomagnetic polarity timescale of Gradstein et al. (2004), and d13C and d18O data were corrected to account for species offsets following Shackleton et al. (1995) and Spero et al. (2003). All d13C data have been corrected to seawater DIC and are reported relative to the VPDB standard. All d18O data have been corrected to G. ruber (planktics) and Uvigerina spp. (benthics) and are specified relative to the VPDB standard.
